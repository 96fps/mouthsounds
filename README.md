# mouthsounds
Mouthsounds is an audio experiment that uses [gentle](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle) to align lyrics to audio for analysis and visualization. See it live at [96fps.net/mouthsounds](www.96fps.net/mouthsounds/).

## What's next?
The page is currently a progressive web-app to display/cache pre-made static examples, but moving forward it will be possible to generate and edit files/projects using the page.
