My friend has problems with winter and autumn
They give him prescriptions,
They shine bright lights on him
They say it's genetic,
They say he can't help it
They say you can catch it
But sometimes you're born with it

My friend has blight
he gets shakes in the night
And they say there is no way
That they could have caught it in
Time takes its toll on him, it is traditional
It is inherited predisposition

All day I've been wondering
What is inside of me,
Who can I blame for it?

I say
It runs in the family,
this famine that carries me
To such great lengths
To open my legs
Up
