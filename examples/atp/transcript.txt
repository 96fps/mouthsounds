All the pictures of your mother, all the places that you know
All the lessons of your lovers and the things you never show
You know you could be mistaking me for somebody else
All the roses you can send to me could sit on my shelf
Now my chain is feeling heavy on my neck when I write
But my heart is beating steady and I know it never lies
Dead could, dead could start to feel and your eyes will start to flood
If you know the kind of steel running in my royal blood
